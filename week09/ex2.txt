Sequence that increase hit/miss ratio:
Let number of frames = 10. 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
First 10 inputs will occur miss, because there is no such "elements" in cache. After that
all inputs will hit, because there are already such "elements" in cache.

Sequence that decrease hit/miss ratio:
All unique "elements" will have 100% miss rating.
More unique "elements" we add, more hit/miss ratio decrease.
